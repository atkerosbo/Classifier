# Classifier
This is a simple straight forward project, using a simple classifier model to determine whats on the picture.

## Challenges:
Used sample code from other autors, but finaly had to rewrite using FLASK.
Production envoirement is a cpanel server, for some reason taipy didnt work properly.

## The model

I've included two notebooks one simpler, one more complex to create the prediction model. These notebooks are used for ML GUI APP that Mariya made, check out also her project

## FLASK
Using this lightweight library a simple app interface is more then enough for this app.
